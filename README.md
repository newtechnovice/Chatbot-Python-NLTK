# Chatbot-Python-NLTK

This is a simple chatbot built with Python using NLTK and Keras following a tutorial from [Data Flair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/).

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate human conversation between a human and a machine; it benefits agents who answers repetitive questions all day and delivers consistent information thus, improving workflow and productivity. 

## Pre-requisites
- A good knowledge of Python, Keras, and NLTK. 


- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**

     Used for building Python programs to work with human language data. To install: 

```
pip install nltk
```
   Read [here](https://www.nltk.org/) for the NLTK documentation.

## Steps to Create a Chatbot
1. Import and load the data file
2. Preprocess data
3. Create training and testing data
4. Build the model
5. Predict the response

### Tasks
- [ ] Determine the chatbot's goals and identify *all* required features and tasks
- [ ] Design dialogue flows 
- [ ] Create a data file in JSON format 

*will add more to this later* 

*Project status as of December 1, 2020: Ongoing*
